# transformation challenge

In this challenge I did very well. I searched for the correct tranform attribute to use to double the size.
When I checked the solution code I noticed that all the values were put togther in one line for the transition.
Not sure if the order impacted the outcome I played around with it and tried all the transition elements in different order. The result was the same so I can now feel confident to do this too.
